## Introduction
----------------

Hello world! This my *first* README in my *first* public repository on Github!

Within this repository, I hope to plan, attempt, and document progress
in my programming projects.
My ongoing goal is to become proficient with Python3 and other programming languages.


## Project List

### Attempted Projects

### Other Programming Languages
-------------------------

**GDScript** - A high-level, dynamically typed programming language used to create content. It uses a syntax similar to Python (blocks are indent-based and many keywords are similar). Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content creation and integration.

**SugarCube** - An alternate JavaScript library for Twine that handles media, media playback functions, advanced linking for passages, UI elements, save files, and much more.
